This directory contains Ansible configuration files and recipes used for configuration of 
Edge Controllers installed at customer sites. Using Ansible to automate configuration of
these devices ensures consistent configuration among sites. The intent is that This
will be run from kbnoc1 and connect to each site's EC via its VPN.

Edge Controller host IP addresses need to be entered in the hosts file in this directory.
Ssh keys must be exchanged between hosts for passwordless loging for the root user 
prior to running run.sh. 

The vagrant_ec directory is used for testing Ansible recipes. It installs a virtualbox
vm running the edge controller software. These Ansible recipes can be run against that 
virtual machine to test them.
